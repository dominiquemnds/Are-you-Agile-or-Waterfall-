# Are-you-Agile-or-Waterfall-
This simple quiz will let you know if you're more suited towards agile or waterfall. Just for fun. Feel free to download and play the quiz!


If you've played any of my other quizzes you might notice that this one is similar but a bit more advanced. Looking at the code difference
between my Fashionista quiz and this one, it's obvious that I've improved. Specifically take a look at the tallyUp and scoreUp functions in
my Fashionista and Agile quiz respectively. The scoring method is completely different. Allowing me to ensure that a result is delivered
everytime. 
Also, the button disabling is done completely differently. Once disabling each one, now I do it implicitly by keeping track of which questions 
have been answered and only allowing one answer per question. 
Another improvement can be seen in regards to how I changed the background color of options after they were clicked. In Agile vs Waterfall 
I was able to complete this function without calling in the element needed by using the event.target function. 

Enjoy the quiz and the overall improvements in my coding style!
